E    A         G
I'm not like them
C              E
But I can pretend
A           G
The sun is gone
    C          E
But I have a light
A            G
The day is done
     C          E
But I'm having fun
A             G
I think I'm dumb
C                E
Or maybe just happy


G               E
Think I'm just happy (x3)

E A            G
 My heart is broke
    C              E
But I have some glue
A          G
Help me inhale
C                 E
And mend it with you
A               G
We'll float around
C                  E
And hang out on clouds
A              G
Then we'll come down
C               E
And have a hangover



G           E
Have A hangover (x3)
