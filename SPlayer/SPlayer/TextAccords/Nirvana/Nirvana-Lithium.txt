I´m so happy because today 
I´ve found my friends 
They´re in my head 
I´m so ugly, but that´s okay, cause so are you 
We´ve broken our mirrors 
Sunday morning is everyday for all I care 
And I´m not scared 
Light my candles in a daze 
Cause I´ve found god

I´m so lonely but that´s okay I shaved my head 
And I´m not sad 
And just maybe I´m to blame for all I´ve heard 
But I´m not sure 
I´m so excited, I can´t wait to meet you there 
But I don´t care 
I´m so horny but that´s okay 
My will is good
