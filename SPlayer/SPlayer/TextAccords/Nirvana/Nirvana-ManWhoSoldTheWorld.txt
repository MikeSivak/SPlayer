                    A
We passed upon the stairs,
                  D
Spoken walls and wells,
                  A
Although I was a friend
                F
Sat on walls astrand,
                    C
Which came as so surprised,
                 A                           
I spoke into his eyes -- 
		       D
I thought you died alone
                    C
A long long time ago

(First chorus):
C
Oh no, not me,
   C#
We never lost control,
C
The face, to face,
         C#                   A
With the man who sold the world.

                        A
I laughed and shook his hand,
                  D
Made my way back home,
                         A
I searched from farther land,
                      F
Years and years I roamed,
                      C
I gazed all gazers there
                     A                         
We walked a million hills -- 
		     D
I must have died alone,
                    C
A long long time ago.

(Second chorus)
C
Who knows, not me,
  C#
I never lost control,
C
Your face, to face,
         C#            A
With the man who sold the world.
