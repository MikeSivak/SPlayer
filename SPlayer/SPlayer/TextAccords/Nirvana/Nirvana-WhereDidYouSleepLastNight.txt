[Verse]
E                      A       G
My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
        B                        E
Tell me where did you sleep last night
E
In the pines, in the pines
          A              G
Where the sun don't ever shine
        B                  E
I would shiver the whole night through

[Chorus]
E                       A        G
My girl, my girl, where will you go
    B                         E
I'm going where the cold wind blows
E
In the pines, in the pines
          A              G
Where the sun don't ever shine
        B                E
I would shiver the whole night through

[Verse]
E                  A            G
Her husband, was a hard working man
     B                 E
Just about a mile from here
E                       A       G
His head was found in a driving wheel
B                      E
But his body never was found

[Verse]
E                      A       G
My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
        B                        E
Tell me where did you sleep last night
E
In the pines, in the pines
          A              G
Where the sun don't ever shine
        B                  E
I would shiver the whole night through
