[Verse]

G             D           G          Em
Polly wants a cracker 
G                  D          C      Em  
Think I should get off of her first 
G                      D        C     Em
I think she wants some water 
G              D    C    Em
To put out the blow torch 


[Chorus]

D        C
It isn't me 
G            A#
We have some seed 
D           C
Let me clip 
G          A#
Your dirty wings 
D             C 
Let me take a ride
G         A# 
Don't cut yourself
D           C 
I want some help 
G         A#   
To please myself
D             C
I've got some rope
G             A# 
You have been told
D         C 
I promise you
G           A# 
I have been true
D             C
Let me take a ride
G            A# 
Don't cut yourself 
D           C
I want some help 
G            A#
To please myself 


[Verse]

G             D           G          Em
Polly wants a cracker 
G                  D          C      Em  
Maybe she would like some food 
G                      D        C     Em
She asks me to untie her 
G              D    C    Em
A chase would be nice for a few 


[Chorus]

D        C
It isn't me 
G            A#
We have some seed 
D           C
Let me clip 
G          A#
Your dirty wings 
D             C 
Let me take a ride
G         A# 
Don't cut yourself
D           C 
I want some help 
G         A#   
To please myself
D             C
I've got some rope
G             A# 
You have been told
D         C 
I promise you
G           A# 
I have been true

Let me take a ride
G            A# 
Don't cut yourself 
D           C
I want some help 
G            A#
To please myself 

Polly says 


[Verse]

G             D           G          Em
Polly says her back hurts 
G                  D          C      Em  
And she's just as bored as me 
G                      D        C     Em
She caught me off my guard 
G              D    C    Em
It amazes me, the will of instinct 


[Chorus]

D        C
It isn't me 
G            A#
We have some seed 
D           C
Let me clip 
G          A#
Your dirty wings 
D             C 
Let me take a ride
G         A# 
Don't cut yourself
D           C 
I want some help 
G         A#   
To please myself
D             C
I've got some rope
G             A# 
You have been told
D         C 
I promise you
G           A# 
I have been true
D             C
Let me take a ride
G            A# 
Don't cut yourself 
D           C
I want some help 
G            A#
To please myself
