  One day in the year of the fox
    Dm        Am
Came a time remembered well
     F
When the strong young man
    G
Of the rising sun heard the
Am
Tolling of the great black bell

(bass)
C         G
  One day in the year of the fox when the
E          Am
Bell began to ring, it meant the
F              G
Time had come for the one to Go to the
Am
Temple of the King


Dm
There in the middle of the circle, he stands
Am
Searching, Seeking,
      G
With just one touch of his trembling hand
     Am
The answer will be found


Dm
Daylight waits for the oldman?s scream
Am
Heaven, help me,
G                Dm
Just like a rush of thousand wings
    E
It shines upon the world
    F    G       Am
And the day has just begun

Far from the circle of the edge of the world

He?s smoking, wandering

Thinking back of the stories he?s told

Before he?s gonna see
