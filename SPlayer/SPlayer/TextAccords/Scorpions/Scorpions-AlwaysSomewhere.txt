C          G           D    Em    Am
Arrive at seven, the place feels good
No time to call you today
Encores till eleven then Chinese food
Back to the hotel again

(проигрыш)

I call your number, the line ain't free
I'd like to tell you come to me
And life without you seems like a lost dream
Love, I can tell you how I feel

припев:  (без перебора)
C       G
Always somewhere
Am                  F
Miss you where I've been
F         G                C     G
I'll be back to love you again

Another morning, another place
The only day off is far away
But every city has seen me in the end
And brings me to you again
